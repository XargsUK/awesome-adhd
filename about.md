Awesome ADHD is a curated list of resources, tools, and information for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The mission is to provide a comprehensive and accessible collection of ADHD-friendly resources to help people manage their symptoms, improve their quality of life, and thrive.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Aggregate high-quality ADHD resources in one place
- Help people with ADHD find tools and information to help them

# How It Works

We collect and organise resources into several categories:

- Apps and Tools
- Content Creators (YouTube, TikTok, etc.)
- Books and Literature
- Websites and Online Resources
- Communities (Subreddits, Discord servers, etc.)
- Other Helpful Resources

Resources are carefully reviewed to ensure they are genuinely helpful for people with ADHD.
